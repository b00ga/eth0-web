I've arrived a little late to tonight's meeting so apologies for any omissions... The success of Software Freedom Day activities by PySIG members has led to open source "Tech Talks" at the [Lawrence Library](http://www.lawrencelibrary.org/) in Pepperell, MA. Mark has been wanting to continue using a piece of orphaned DOS/Windows software and some handy Windows tools came up. [Process Monitor](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx) and [Revo Uninstaller](http://www.revouninstaller.com/). The Windows kernel debugger [SoftICE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftICE) was mentioned. Also [TeaTimer](http://www.safer-networking.org/en/faq/33.html), a process monitor that is part of [Spybot Search & Destroy](http://www.safer-networking.org/en/home/index.html) was mentioned. It appears that the software, [allCLEAR](http://www.allclearonline.com/), may still exist. Bill writes his Python in the free source code editor, [SciTE](http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html). He had some gotchas about debugging in this environment, and mentioned the usefulness of 'python -i'. The python debugger, [pdb](http://docs.python.org/lib/module-pdb.html), got a few CPU cycles during the discussion. Kent's Korner, [urllib2 Cookbook](http://personalpages.tds.net/~kent37/kk/00010.html) Main presentation. Arc Riley on [PySoy](http://www.pysoy.org/), a 3D game engine. Arc also mentioned the serach for students to work on Python projects for [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/). I'll refer you to [his recent post](http://dlslug.org/pipermail/python-talk/2008-March/000732.html) on the [Python-talk mailing list](http://dlslug.org/mailman/listinfo/python-talk). -Shawn
