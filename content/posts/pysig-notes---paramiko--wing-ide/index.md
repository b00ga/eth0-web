Just a quick post to distribute links from my PySIG talk from tonight. paramiko, the Python SSH2 module, is located at [http://www.lag.net/paramiko/](http://www.lag.net/paramiko/) The source for the python scripts demonstrated can be downloaded [here](../downloadparamiko-pysig-sept2007targz) NOTE: You will need to copy interactive.py from the demos/ directory of the paramiko distribution to somewhere in PYTHONPATH in order to run the getshell.py sample. The feature comparison for the versions of Wing: [http://wingware.com/wingide/features](http://wingware.com/wingide/features) Wing slides from the Boston/Cambridge Python group's Wing presentation: [http://wingware.com/psupport/talks/wing-intro/wing-intro.html](http://wingware.com/psupport/talks/wing-intro/wing-intro.html) -Shawn
