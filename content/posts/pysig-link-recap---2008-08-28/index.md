Back after a few months missing! Arrived late, which seems to be the standard for me lately... As I sat down, folks were discussing goings-on for [Software Freedom Day](http://softwarefreedomday.org/). For some more multimedia Python related Internet content, you can check out [the Python411 podcast](http://www.awaretek.com/python/) at [Python Learning Foundation](http://www.awaretek.com/plf.html) and [Python Tutorial Screencasts and Videos](http://showmedo.com/videos/python) at [ShowMeDo](http://showmedo.com/). A great news aggregator for Python news is [Planet Python](http://planetpython.org/). Shawn mentioned a new Python conference, [PyWorks](http://pyworks.mtacon.com/), happening Nov 12-14 in Atlanta. They recently announced their [conference schedule](http://pyworks.mtacon.com/c/schedule). It is organized by the folks that publish [Python Magazine](http://pymag.phparch.com/). Shawn also mentioned that he found out about this from [Doug Hellmann's blog](http://blog.doughellmann.com/), which has a great weekly feature, the Python Module of the Week. Kent took over for [this month's Kent's Korner](http://personalpages.tds.net/~kent37/kk/00013.html), where he showed us [defaultdict objects in the collections module](http://docs.python.org/lib/defaultdict-objects.html) of the Python standard library. Ray then took over for the main presentation for the night, "A Glimpse at BOSS." [Yahoo!](http://www.yahoo.com) offers a web service called [Yahoo! Search BOSS](http://developer.yahoo.com/search/boss/) (where BOSS stands for Build your Own Search Service). Yahoo! is now providing [BOSS Mashup Framework](http://developer.yahoo.com/search/boss/mashup.html). To quote their website, "The BOSS Mashup Framework is an experimental Python library that provides developers with SQL-like constructs for mashing up the BOSS API with third-party data sources." Some discussion of licensing came up. Yahoo! states that the BOSS Mashup Framework is covered by the [Yahoo! Search BOSS Services Terms of Use](http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/search/bosstos/bosstos-2317.html).Â This discussion also brought up mention of theÂ [AGPL](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) or GNU Affero General Public License. During his talk, Ray mentioned [Aptana](http://www.aptana.com/), a software company that provides an IDE for doing AJAX development. They recently hired the author of the [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) [PyDev extension](http://pydev.sourceforge.net/), and [PyDev](http://www.aptana.com/python) is now also available for their [Aptana Studio](http://www.aptana.com/studio).Bill mentioned a HAM Radio magazine article that he noticed involved some Python! The article, "D-RATS â€” an Application Suite for D-STAR", is available as a [PDF on-line](http://static.danplanet.com/preserve/KK7DS_QST_D-RATS.pdf). Software Freedom Day activities discussion resurged, and Bill mentioned [OpenDisc](http://www.theopendisc.com/). Quoting OpenDisc's website, "OpenDisc is a high quality collection of open source software (OSS) for the Microsoft Windows operating system." See you next month! -Shawn
