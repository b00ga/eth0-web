[Ubuntu Open Week](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOpenWeek), April 28-May 3, is an event presenting a series of online workshops. There is a presentation on May 1st of interest to Pythonistas entitled "Python Packaging - Emilio Pozuelo Monfort". [Mailing list announcement](http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/python/announce/641173?page=last) [David M. Beazley's](http://www.dabeaz.com/) PyCon 2008 Presentation on generators, [Generator Tricks for Systems Programmers](http://www.dabeaz.com/generators/index.html), is a very accessible introduction to doing very cool things with Python generators. Ted pointed us to an interesting article, [A conversation with Ray Ozzie about Live Mesh.](http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/04/23/a-conversation-with-ray-ozzie-about-live-mesh/) Ted also told us about a Python RSS aggregator, [Planet](http://www.planetplanet.org/). He maintains a page of Foxpro related links using it, [Planet Fox](http://www.tedroche.com/tedsriver/). And Python news can be had at [Planet Python](http://planet.python.org/). Shawn kept telling Ted he could [turn off syntax highlighting in vim](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/turn-on-or-off-color-syntax-highlighting-in-vi-or-vim/) quickly and easily. [xkcd](http://xkcd.com) likes Python!

 Ray mentioned [Python Powered SpreadSheet (PPSS)](http://olivier.friard.free.fr/software/ppss/index.php), a spreadsheet program based on the Python programming language. Ted countered by bringing up that OpenOffice is scriptable in Python with [pyUNO](http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Python). The Python Twisted network engine has a new version, [8.0](http://labs.twistedmatrix.com/2008/03/twisted-80-released.html). Various discussions of cryptography. [pyCrypto](http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto.html). [PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2). [Linux Unified Key Setup or LUKS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LUKS). [TrueCrypt](http://www.truecrypt.org/). [Apple FileVault](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileVault). [eCryptfs.](http://ecryptfs.sourceforge.net/) The various downloadable versions and variants of [OpenSolaris](http://opensolaris.org/os/downloads/) came up. Also the fact that [disk encryption for the ZFS filesystem](http://opensolaris.org/os/project/zfs-crypto/) is an OpenSolaris project. Ted reminded us that Todd Underwood presented to [MerriLUG in the past](http://wiki.gnhlug.org/twiki2/bin/view/Www/PastEvents) on ZFS and [his slides](http://wiki.gnhlug.org/twiki2/pub/Www/ZfsSlides/zfs2.pdf) are available online. -Shawn
