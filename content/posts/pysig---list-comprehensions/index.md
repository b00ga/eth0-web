[Slides](/blog/pysig/comprehensions.html) for my July 26 PySIG presentation, introducing Python list comprehensions. This presentation was my first usage of [landslide](https://github.com/adamzap/landslide), a Python HTML5 slide presenting tool. If you're interested in the reStructuredText source for this presentation, I'm providing that as well: [comprehensions.rst](/blog/pysig/comprehensions.rst).
