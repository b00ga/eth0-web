So I've been thinking about doing a podcast for awhile now, and I sat down and did my first. Frank says I listen to the radio too much, and he's probably right. I mostly listen to what is deemed these days as an alternative rock radio station. This podcast is kind of my flavor of the kind of music that I like that you would here over there. The goal is to do two a month, 30-35 minutes, which will fit about 7 songs. Currently I'm doing it at 128-kbit MP3, which might be too much, since it makes the files ~30 Meg. We'll see, maybe I'll start dumping it later at lower quality. Anyway, the first edition, for Early February 2006 features: Weezer - "Perfect Situation", The All-American Rejects - "Move Along", She Wants Revenge - "Tear You Apart", The Killers - "Jenny Was a Friend of Mine", Death Cab for Cutie - "Crooked Teeth", Matisyahu - "King Without a Crown", and Morningwood - "Nth Degree". Please give it a whirl and let me know what you think. You can direct download the MP3 from here: [Musically Infectious - 1st Dosage](http://www.eth0.net/podcasts/Musically%20Infectious-1st%20Dosage.mp3) or use this URL to subscribe to this podcast: http://eth0.net/podcast/ -b00ga
