Aaaaaaaaand October notes... Kent's Korner this month was [an introduction to the Python unittest module](http://personalpages.tds.net/~kent37/kk/00014.html). After Kent's presentation, a discussion on unit testing ensued, talking more about [the unittest module](http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html), Java's unit testing package [Junit](http://www.junit.org/), and another popular Python unit testing package [nose](http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/). We then moved on to our main presentation, where Arc schooled us about [Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/). Sphinx is a tool for creating and maintaining Python documentation. Sphinx extends [reStructured Text](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) to support documenting Python. The Sphinx markup extensions are [documented](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/markup/index.html) in the Sphinx docs. Sphinx currently uses [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) for it's templating. More discussion of restructured text ensued. Kent mentioned that he writes Kent's Korner in ReST, using [Firedrop](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/firedrop2/). It was discussed that ReST is pretty ubiquitous, for example, [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/)Ã‚ [supports ReST](http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/WikiRestructuredText) and [MoinMoin](http://moinmo.in/) [does as well](http://moinmo.in/ReStructuredText). New Linux distros coming, [Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex](http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/intrepid/beta) in seven days and [Fedora 10](http://fedoraproject.org/get-prerelease) is landing soon as well. Arc mentioned [Ubuntu Local Community](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoTeams) teams, and our [local New Hampshire chapter](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewHampshireTeam). -Shawn
