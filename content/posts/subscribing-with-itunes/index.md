So if a podcast isn't listed in the iTunes music store, it really didn't jump out at me how you added one to iTunes. After a little poking around, it turns out to be very easy. From the Advanced menu, choose Subscribe to Podcast, and in the popup, enter the URL http://eth0.net/podcast. Click OK and off it goes. -b00ga
